# the conversion of one data type into the another data typeis known as casting in python
#python support a wide variety of function or method like int, float str ord hex oct tuple
# it two type of typecasting
# explicit conversion 2 implicit conversion
# explicit conversion  is done by coader
# implict typecasting   one data type convert in another data type. it done by python it self
